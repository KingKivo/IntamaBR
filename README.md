my own personal version of Zetsu by Orion on IOS with inspirations from Tachiyomi also in concept. Much like the inspiration, it will also be module based. To be honest I mainly started this project for my own interests and to make a private app for my close circle. But in planning it out in my head I also want to polish my programming skills and get better and learn more and I think documenting it here will be helpful to that. Any insights or help will be infinitly appreciated.
